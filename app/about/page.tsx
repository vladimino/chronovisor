        <p>
          The name &quot;Chronovisor&quot; originates from a mythical device described by Father Fran√ßois Brune in his 2002 book *The Vatican&apos;s New Mystery*. Allegedly invented by Father Pellegrino Ernetti, this device was said to allow its user to view past events. This project serves as a modern &quot;time machine&quot; for historical exploration.
